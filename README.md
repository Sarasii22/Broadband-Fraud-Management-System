# Broadband Fraud Batch API

A FastAPI service for scoring stored broadband transaction records in MongoDB and flagging suspicious activity with a combination of rules and an XGBoost model.

This project is designed for batch processing with **automatic background scoring**. You add transaction data to MongoDB (however you like), and a background worker automatically scores it and stores the results — no manual API call required. You can then pull fraud statistics, visualizations, and a downloadable PDF report for any time period.

## What this project does

- Loads transaction records from MongoDB
- Applies rule-based scoring and machine-learning scoring
- Combines both scores into a final fraud decision
- **Automatically scores new transactions in the background** as soon as they're added to MongoDB, no manual trigger needed
- Stores every scored result with a timestamp, so it can be queried by time period later
- Exposes a batch prediction API through FastAPI (for on-demand/manual scoring)
- Exposes a time-range statistics API with a MongoDB aggregation pipeline (fraud/normal counts, percentages, per-rule breakdown)
- Generates a downloadable PDF report for any selected time period
- Ships with a synthetic training dataset so you can run it locally end to end

## Requirements

- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python 3.11 or newer recommended
- MongoDB Community Server running locally, or a MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Internet access to install Python dependencies

## Install Python

Check your Python version first:

```powershell
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and make sure it is added to PATH.

## Create a virtual environment

From the project root folder `fraud_api`, run:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run this once in the current terminal:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then activate the environment again.

## Install dependencies

With the virtual environment activated:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This includes `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pymongo`, `xgboost`, `pyyaml`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `reportlab` (used to generate PDF reports).

## Configure MongoDB

By default the app connects to:

- `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- database: `fraud_api`
- raw transactions collection: `transactions`
- scored predictions collection: `fraud_predictions` (created automatically)

If you want to override these values, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB=fraud_api
MONGODB_COLLECTION=transactions
MONGODB_PREDICTIONS_COLLECTION=fraud_predictions
```

If you are using MongoDB Atlas, replace `MONGODB_URI` with your Atlas connection string.

## Start MongoDB

### Local MongoDB

Make sure the MongoDB service is running on your machine before starting the API.

### MongoDB Atlas

If you use Atlas, update `.env` with your cluster URI and make sure your IP address is allowed in the Atlas network access settings.

## Train the model

The API expects a trained model file at `app/models/fraud_model.json`.

Generate it from the training script:

```powershell
python training\train_model.py
```

What this does:

- loads or generates synthetic broadband fraud data
- trains an XGBoost classifier
- saves the model to `app/models/fraud_model.json`

Important:

- The included training script uses synthetic data so you can run the project immediately.
- For real-world use, replace the synthetic data generation in `training/train_model.py` with your own labeled historical data.

## Run the API

From the project root:

```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

On startup, the app will:

1. Load the XGBoost model
2. Ensure MongoDB indexes exist on `fraud_predictions` (`created_at`, `customer_id`, `document_id`)
3. **Start the background auto-scoring poller** — this runs every 5 seconds and automatically scores any transaction in `transactions` that hasn't been scored yet, saving the result into `fraud_predictions` with a timestamp

Then open:

- API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
- Web dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Adding transaction data (two supported ways)

### Option 1 — Import a CSV dataset

```powershell
python scripts\import_csv_to_mongodb.py
```

This reads the CSV you provide and inserts the rows into the configured MongoDB collection.

If your source file uses the transaction table format you shared, the import script will preserve these raw fields:

- `subscriber_id`
- `record_opening_time`
- `record_closing_time`
- `cc_total_octets_bytes`
- `cc_input_octets_bytes`
- `cc_output_octets_bytes`
- `load_date`

For compatibility with the existing API, it also stores `customer_id` as an alias of `subscriber_id`.

### Option 2 — Insert a small hand-crafted test set

```powershell
python scripts\add_sample_transactions.py
```

This inserts a mix of obviously-fraudulent, obviously-legitimate, and borderline records, useful for quickly testing the dashboard end to end.

### Your own data

If you have your own data, insert documents into the `transactions` collection using the same field structure the API expects (see below). **You don't need to call any endpoint afterward** — the background auto-scorer picks up new documents automatically within a few seconds.

### Expected transaction fields

Each MongoDB document in `transactions` can use either the raw subscriber table shape or the legacy fraud-feature shape.

Raw subscriber table example:

```json
{
  "subscriber_id": "SUB_365EECB8",
  "record_opening_time": "2026-05-16T11:00:00",
  "record_closing_time": "2026-05-16T10:00:00",
  "cc_total_octets_bytes": 0,
  "cc_input_octets_bytes": 8094,
  "cc_output_octets_bytes": 0,
  "load_date": "2026-05-17T05:04:50"
}
```

The app derives the legacy scoring fields from this raw shape when you batch-score documents.

## How automatic scoring works

The workflow is intentionally reduced to two steps for day-to-day use:

1. **Add data** to the `transactions` collection (via a script, MongoDB Compass, `mongosh`, or your own ingestion process).
2. **View results** on the dashboard or via the API for whatever time period you care about.

Behind the scenes, `app/services/auto_scorer.py` runs a background thread that:

- Every 5 seconds, checks `transactions` for documents whose `_id` doesn't yet have a matching `document_id` in `fraud_predictions`
- Scores any new documents using the same rules + ML + ensemble logic as `/predict`
- Saves the results into `fraud_predictions` with a `created_at` timestamp (UTC)

This means each transaction is scored automatically exactly once — no duplicate work, no manual trigger.

## Manual batch scoring (still available)

`POST /predict` remains available for on-demand, manual scoring of everything currently in `transactions` (useful for forcing a re-score, or scoring a specific customer/subset).

### Request

```http
POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example body:

```json
{
  "collection_name": "transactions",
  "customer_id": null,
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Example cURL (PowerShell)

```powershell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"collection_name":"transactions","customer_id":null,"skip":0,"limit":100}'
```

### Response

The response includes:

- `collection_name`
- `matched_count`
- `predictions`
- `summary`

Each prediction contains:

- `document_id`
- `customer_id`
- `is_fraud`
- `rule_score`
- `ml_score`
- `final_score`
- `decision`
- `triggered_rules`
- `model_version`

Note: calling `/predict` re-scores everything matching the query each time, which can create duplicate entries in `fraud_predictions` for the same customer if run repeatedly. This is fine for occasional manual/ad-hoc scoring, but the recommended day-to-day workflow is to just add data and let the background auto-scorer handle it once per record.

## Fraud statistics by time period

### `POST /stats/by-time`

Returns fraud statistics for a given time window, computed via a MongoDB aggregation pipeline against `fraud_predictions`.

Request body:

```json
{
  "start_time": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2026-07-08T23:59:59Z"
}
```

Response includes:

- `total_records`, `fraud_count`, `normal_count`
- `fraud_percentage`, `normal_percentage`
- `records`: individual scored records in the range (`customer_id`, `is_fraud`, `decision`, scores, `triggered_rules`, `created_at`)
- `rule_breakdown`: for each triggered rule, how many times it fired in this period and what percentage of those firings were confirmed fraud

**Timezone note:** timestamps are stored in UTC. The dashboard converts your local time picker input into a proper UTC ISO string before querying, so results are correct regardless of your local timezone.

### `POST /stats/by-time/report`

Same request body as above, but returns a downloadable PDF instead of JSON — includes a summary table, a triggered-rules-vs-fraud-percentage chart, and a detailed records table (with a color-coded Fraud Status column: red for fraud, green for normal).

## Web dashboard

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to use the dashboard. It provides:

- A time-range picker ("Fraud Statistics by Time Period")
- Summary boxes: total records, fraud %, normal %
- A bar visualization of triggered rules vs. their fraud percentage
- A detailed records table with a **Fraud Status** column (red = FRAUD, green = NOT FRAUD) and the Decision, Final Score, Triggered Rules, and Scored At columns
- A **Download PDF Report** button that generates the same report shown above as a file

## Running tests

Run the automated test suite with:

```powershell
python -m pytest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows 0 records even though I added data

The auto-scorer runs every 5 seconds — wait a few seconds after adding data before checking. You can confirm it worked by checking the server logs for:

```
Auto-scorer found N new transaction(s) to score
Auto-scorer saved N new predictions to fraud_predictions
```

or by running:

```powershell
python scripts\check_recent_predictions.py
```

### `FileNotFoundError` for the CSV file

Run the importer from the project root, or use:

```powershell
python scripts\import_csv_to_mongodb.py
```

The script uses a path relative to its own location, so it does not depend on the current working directory.

### `pymongo is not installed` / `reportlab is not installed`

Install dependencies again with:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### MongoDB connection errors

Check that:

- MongoDB is running
- the URI in `.env` is correct
- the database and collection names match your data

### API starts but `/predict` or the dashboard fails

Make sure you have:

- trained the model with `python training\train_model.py`
- loaded documents into MongoDB
- documents that contain all required fields

## How the scoring works

The service combines:

- rule-based fraud signals from `app/config/rules.yaml`
- machine-learning probability from the XGBoost model
- a final ensemble decision generated in the service layer

This gives you both a decision and traceability (via `triggered_rules`) for why a record was flagged.

## Notes for development

- Edit `app/config/rules.yaml` to adjust thresholds
- Restart the app after changing rules or the model
- The auto-scorer poll interval is configurable via `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` at the top of `app/services/auto_scorer.py`
- Use the synthetic data and training pipeline as a local demo setup before plugging in real data
